This is a automated class availabity checker I created using puppeteer to inform me when there is a free slot in a full class. It got twilio and will send and SMS when the class is available. The program refresh the class list every minute to see an available stlot.

You will need to login from chrome and set your cookie dir in the app.js so it bypass authentication.

Use headless false to see the browser.
